All images in the [astrophotography gallery](/photography/astrophotography/) were captured remotely through [iTelescope.net](https://www.itelescope.net/) — a network of professional-grade telescopes spanning three continents. Planning was done with Starry Night Pro Plus, FITS files were processed through CCDStack and Adobe Photoshop, and photometric analysis was contributed to the [American Association of Variable Star Observers](https://www.aavso.org/) through VPHOT.
