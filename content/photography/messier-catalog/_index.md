The *Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles* was assembled by French astronomer Charles Messier and originally released in 1771. It catalogs 110 galaxies, star clusters, nebulae, and supernova remnants — the brightest and most accessible deep sky objects visible from the northern hemisphere.

By late 2014, 99 of 110 had been photographed through the [remote telescope network](/photography/telescopes/). Click any object below to view it full size with telescope and location details.
