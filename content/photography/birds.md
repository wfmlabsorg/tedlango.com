Shot with a Nikon D7100 and Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3. Most of these were taken during trips to Colombia's Antioquia region and Costa Rica's highlands — two of the richest birding corridors on the planet. The life list below tracks every species I've photographed, with dates and locations where available.
