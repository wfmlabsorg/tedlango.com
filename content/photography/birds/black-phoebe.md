  description: "A neat, smartly plumaged flycatcher that is entirely sooty black except for a clean white belly and white outer tail feathers. The black plumage has a slightly sooty quality without strong gloss. Almost always found near water, perching on rocks, bridges, fences, or low branches along streams, ponds, and lakeshores. An active sit-and-wait predator, sallying out to catch flying insects over water and then returning to the same perch. Pumps its tail frequently while perched; gives a sharp, thin 'tsip' call and a simple 'fee-bee' song."
