  description: "Males are distinctive with a bright orange-yellow forehead and face, olive-yellow upperparts, and yellow underparts with an olive breast band, while females are considerably duller olive-green overall with a yellowish belly. A small, warbler-like tanager often found in the canopy. Inhabits humid and semi-humid forest edges, second growth, and wooded gardens from Colombia through Brazil. Actively forages in mixed-species flocks, gleaning insects and eating small berries from outer foliage."
