  description: "A medium-sized, dark ibis with glossy greenish-black plumage showing iridescent purple and green reflections on the wings and back. The most distinctive feature is the extensive bare, pinkish-red facial skin extending from the base of the decurved bill around the eye. Found in open wetlands, flooded pastures, marshes, and agricultural fields in South America. Gregarious, often foraging in flocks while probing soft mud for invertebrates; flies in loose V-formations to communal roosts."
