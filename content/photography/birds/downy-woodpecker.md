  description: "The smallest woodpecker in North America, with a black-and-white plumage pattern including white back stripe, black wings with white spotting, white underparts, and a short chisel-like bill. Males show a small red patch on the back of the head. Closely resembles the larger Hairy Woodpecker but has a proportionally shorter bill and smaller black marks on the white outer tail feathers. Common in deciduous and mixed woodlands, orchards, parks, and suburban areas. Readily visits feeders for suet; gives a high, sharp 'pik' call and a descending whinnying rattle."
