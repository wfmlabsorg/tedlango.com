  description: "A medium-sized, mostly green parakeet with scattered red and yellow feathers on the head and neck, red at the bend of the wing, and a conspicuous white bare eye ring that gives the species its name. The long, graduated tail and strong direct flight are typical of Psittacara parakeets. Native to South America, found in forest edges, gallery forests, palm groves, and urban areas; also established as feral populations in parts of North America. Gregarious, roosting and traveling in noisy flocks that give loud, screeching calls."
