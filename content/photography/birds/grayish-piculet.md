  description: "A tiny woodpecker, barely larger than a warbler, with mostly grayish-olive upperparts, pale grayish-white underparts with faint dark barring or streaking, and a black-and-white forecrown pattern (males show a small red or orange-yellow frontal patch). Endemic to Colombia, found in dry and semi-humid forest edges, scrub, and gardens, particularly in the Cauca and Magdalena valleys. Forages actively on thin branches and twigs, tapping and probing for small insects. Moves through vegetation in a rapid, jerky manner; gives thin, high-pitched trilling calls."
