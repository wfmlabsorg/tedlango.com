  description: "A small, sparrow-like finch with males showing a black hood covering the head, throat, and upper breast, olive-green upperparts, and yellowish-buff underparts. Females are much plainer, olive-brown above with buffy-yellow underparts and no black. The short, thick conical bill is adapted for cracking grass seeds. Common in weedy fields, grasslands, agricultural areas, and open scrub from Costa Rica through South America. Typically seen in small flocks feeding on grass seed heads; gives a pleasant, sweet warbling song from exposed perches."
