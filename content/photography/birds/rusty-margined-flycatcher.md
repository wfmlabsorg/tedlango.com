  description: "A medium-sized flycatcher closely resembling the Social Flycatcher, with olive-brown upperparts, a white throat, yellow underparts, and a dark head with a bold white supercilium and a concealed orange-yellow crown patch. The rufous-edged wing feathers give the 'rusty-margined' name, though this can be subtle in the field. Found in semi-open areas, forest edges, riverbanks, gardens, and urban parks in northern South America. Best distinguished by its voice: a sharp, emphatic 'chi-chi-FWEE' call given frequently from exposed perches."
