  description: "A medium-sized, chicken-like bird endemic to Colombia, with plain brownish-olive upperparts, grayish head and neck, and a rufous-tipped tail. The bare reddish throat skin is visible at close range. Inhabits dry and semi-humid forest edges, scrub, plantations, and gardens in the Cauca and Magdalena valleys. Highly vocal, especially at dawn and dusk, when groups produce loud, raucous cackling choruses of 'cha-cha-LAK-a' that can carry for considerable distances."
