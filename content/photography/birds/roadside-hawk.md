  description: "A small to medium-sized, compact raptor and one of the most commonly seen hawks in Latin America. Adults have gray-brown upperparts, a barred rufous-and-white breast, and yellow-orange eyes and cere. The relatively short, rounded wings and banded tail are adapted for maneuvering through semi-open habitats. True to its name, frequently perches conspicuously on roadside wires, poles, and low branches; gives a loud, complaining 'eee-yaaah' call, especially during the breeding season."
