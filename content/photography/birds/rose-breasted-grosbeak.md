  description: "Breeding males are boldly patterned with a black head, back, wings, and tail, a bright white breast with a vivid rose-red triangular bib, and white wing patches and rump. Females are heavily streaked brown-and-white with a bold white supercilium, resembling a large sparrow. Found in deciduous and mixed forests, forest edges, orchards, and parks during breeding in eastern North America; winters from Mexico to South America. Gives a rich, melodious warbling song reminiscent of a robin but more polished; the call is a distinctive metallic 'eek' squeak."
