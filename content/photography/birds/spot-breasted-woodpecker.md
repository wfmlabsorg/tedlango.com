  description: "A medium-sized, colorful woodpecker with olive-green upperparts, a bold red crown and nape, yellowish face with a dark malar stripe, and creamy-white underparts heavily spotted with black. The rump is yellowish-green and the tail is dark. Found in open and semi-open habitats including savannas, forest edges, clearings, and urban parks in northern South America. Often forages on the ground, probing for ants, and is frequently seen in pairs; gives a loud, rolling 'wicka-wicka' call."
