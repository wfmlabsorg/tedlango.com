  description: "A tiny, active flycatcher with olive-green upperparts, a distinctive golden-yellow face with a narrow dark eye line, and yellowish underparts with an olive wash on the breast. The wings show two pale wing bars. Inhabits humid montane forests, forest edges, and tall second growth in the Andes, typically in the canopy and subcanopy. Constantly on the move, gleaning small insects from foliage; frequently joins mixed-species flocks and gives a thin, high-pitched 'tsee' call."
