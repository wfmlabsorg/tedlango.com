  description: "A tall, elegant shorebird with striking black-and-white plumage, an extremely long needle-thin black bill, and absurdly long pink-red legs. The black extends from the crown down the back of the neck and across the upperparts, contrasting sharply with the all-white underparts. Found in shallow wetlands, flooded fields, salt ponds, and mudflats across the Americas. Highly vocal and aggressively territorial when nesting, producing sharp, incessant 'kik-kik-kik' alarm calls while circling intruders on lanky legs."
