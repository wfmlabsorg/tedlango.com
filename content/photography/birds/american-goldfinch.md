  description: "Breeding males are unmistakable with brilliant lemon-yellow body plumage, a black cap, black wings with bold white wing bars, and a white rump. Winter males, females, and immatures are much duller olive-brown with yellowish wash and darker wings. Found in weedy fields, gardens, roadsides, and woodland edges across North America. Strictly vegetarian, feeding almost exclusively on seeds, particularly from composites like thistles and sunflowers. One of the latest nesting songbirds, timing breeding to coincide with midsummer seed abundance; gives a distinctive bounding, undulating flight call of 'po-ta-to-chip.'"
