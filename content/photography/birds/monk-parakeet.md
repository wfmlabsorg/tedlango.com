  description: "A medium-sized, bright green parakeet with a distinctive pale gray forehead, face, and breast, giving it a 'hooded' appearance. The belly shows a faint yellowish-green wash and the flight feathers are blue. Unlike most parrots, builds large communal stick nests rather than nesting in cavities, often on utility poles and other man-made structures. Native to South America but widely established as a feral species in North America and Europe. Gregarious and noisy, traveling in flocks with rapid, direct flight; gives harsh, chattering calls."
