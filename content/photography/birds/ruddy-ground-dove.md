  description: "A small, compact dove with males showing warm ruddy-brown overall coloring with a blue-gray head, scattered black spots on the wing coverts, and a dark bill. Females are plainer, more grayish-brown with reduced spotting. One of the most common and widespread doves in Latin America, found in open and semi-open areas including agricultural fields, roadsides, and urban yards. Forages almost exclusively on the ground for seeds, often in pairs; gives a soft, repetitive 'woo-woo' cooing call."
