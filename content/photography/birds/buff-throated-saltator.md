  description: "A large, heavy-billed songbird with olive-green upperparts, a gray head with a bold white supercilium and black-bordered white throat patch tinged with buff, and grayish to olive underparts. The thick, dark bill is well-suited for cracking seeds and fruits. Found in humid forest edges, second growth, gardens, and coffee plantations from Mexico through South America. Gives a rich, melodious song often delivered from a concealed perch in dense vegetation; typically skulking but responsive to pishing."
