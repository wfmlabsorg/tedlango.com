  description: "A large, stunning oriole with bright golden-yellow body plumage and contrasting black face mask, throat, wings, and tail. The back is entirely yellow, distinguishing it from other black-and-yellow orioles in its range. Found in semi-open habitats including forest edges, gardens, shade-coffee plantations, and second growth in Colombia, Venezuela, and Central America. Gives a rich, melodious series of whistled notes; builds a long, hanging pouch-like nest typical of orioles."
