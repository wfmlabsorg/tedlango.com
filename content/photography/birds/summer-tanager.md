  description: "Adult males are entirely rose-red with no black, making them the only completely red bird in North America. Females are olive-yellow above and deeper yellow below, sometimes with an orange wash. First-year males are patchy red and yellow-green. Found in open deciduous and mixed woodlands, forest edges, and riparian corridors during breeding; winters in tropical forests and second growth from Mexico to South America. Specializes in catching bees and wasps, beating them against branches to remove stingers; gives a sharp 'pit-a-tuck' call."
