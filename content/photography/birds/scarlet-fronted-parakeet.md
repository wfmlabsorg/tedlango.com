  description: "A medium-sized, mostly green parakeet with a conspicuous red forehead patch and narrow red leading edge on the wing, with a relatively long graduated tail. Found in montane and foothill regions of the northern Andes, typically between 1,000 and 3,000 meters, in semi-open areas, agricultural zones, and forest edges. Highly social, traveling in noisy flocks that can number in the dozens or hundreds. Gives loud, harsh screeching calls in flight, and roosts communally on cliff faces and tall trees."
