  description: "A small, compact corvid with a black cap and face, contrasting silver-gray nape and sides of neck, and pale whitish-blue eyes. The body is otherwise dark gray-black. One of the most social corvids, forming large flocks and nesting colonially in chimneys, cliff faces, old buildings, and tree cavities across Europe and western Asia. Highly intelligent and playful, often seen performing acrobatic flights around buildings and church steeples. Gives a distinctive, sharp 'tchack' call that gives the species its name."
