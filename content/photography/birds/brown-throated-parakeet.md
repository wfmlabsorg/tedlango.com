  description: "A medium-sized, mostly green parakeet with a diagnostic brownish-orange throat and cheek patches, a blue forecrown, and a bare whitish eye ring. The belly often shows a variable orange-yellow patch. Found in dry scrub, semi-arid woodlands, mangroves, urban areas, and agricultural lands from Panama through northern South America and the Caribbean islands. Highly social, traveling in noisy, fast-flying flocks; nests colonially in termite mounds and arboreal termitaria. Gives harsh screeching calls in flight."
