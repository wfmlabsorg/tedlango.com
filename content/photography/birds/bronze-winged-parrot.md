  description: "A stocky, dark parrot with primarily dark blue plumage, a pinkish throat patch, white chin, and distinctive bronzy-olive wing coverts visible in good light. The undertail coverts are red and the tail is short and squared. Inhabits humid montane forest and forest borders in the Andes, typically between 800 and 2,500 meters. Usually seen in pairs or small flocks flying above the canopy at dawn and dusk; gives loud, high-pitched squawking calls in flight."
