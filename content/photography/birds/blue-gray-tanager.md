  description: "A medium-sized tanager that appears mostly pale blue-gray overall with brighter cerulean-blue highlights on the wings and tail. One of the most widespread and familiar tanagers in the Neotropics, found in virtually any semi-open habitat from gardens and city parks to forest edges and plantations. Gregarious and often seen in pairs or small groups, frequently visiting fruiting trees and bird feeders. Gives a thin, high-pitched squeaky call while foraging actively through mid-level and canopy vegetation."
