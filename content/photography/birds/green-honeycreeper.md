  description: "Males are a striking bright turquoise-green overall with a black head and a conspicuous bright yellow bill, while females are uniform grass-green with a paler, less contrasting bill. Despite the name, this species is actually a tanager rather than a true honeycreeper. Inhabits the canopy and edges of humid lowland and foothill forests, as well as tall second growth and shade-coffee plantations. Often joins mixed-species feeding flocks, piercing small fruits with its slightly decurved bill and also visiting flowering trees for nectar."
