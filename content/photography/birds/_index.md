Photos taken across years with everything from a phone to a Nikon D7100 with a Sigma 150-600mm. Most are from Colombia's Antioquia region and South Florida, with others from Costa Rica, Ecuador, and wherever else I happen to spot something worth documenting. The life list below tracks every species I've identified, sorted by photo count — I'm slowly working back through my archive to fill in the gaps.
