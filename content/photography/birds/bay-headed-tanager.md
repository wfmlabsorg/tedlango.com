  description: "A colorful, medium-sized tanager with a rich chestnut-rufous head contrasting with bright green upperparts and turquoise-blue underparts. The nape often shows a narrow golden-yellow collar. Found in humid montane forest canopy, forest edges, and tall second growth in the Andes and adjacent lowlands. Typically forages in pairs or mixed-species flocks in the upper canopy, feeding primarily on small fruits; gives thin, high-pitched call notes."
