  description: "A small, drab flycatcher with grayish-brown upperparts, indistinct pale wing bars, and whitish underparts with a faint grayish-olive wash on the breast. The pale lower mandible and subtle whitish supercilium are helpful field marks. One of the most nondescript tyrannids, easily overlooked among similar-looking small flycatchers. Found in dry scrub, forest edges, gardens, and semi-open areas from Costa Rica through South America. Best identified by voice: gives a distinctive, thin, rising 'fwee-fwee-fwee' dawn song."
