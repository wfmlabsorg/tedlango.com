  description: "An iconic, unmistakably large parrot with brilliant scarlet-red plumage covering the head, body, and upper wing coverts, a bright yellow mid-wing band, and blue flight feathers and rump. The face has large bare white skin patches and the massive pale upper mandible contrasts with a dark lower mandible. Found in humid lowland forests, forest edges, and savannas from southern Mexico through the Amazon basin. Usually seen in pairs or small family groups flying high overhead with slow, powerful wingbeats; gives loud, raucous screeching calls."
