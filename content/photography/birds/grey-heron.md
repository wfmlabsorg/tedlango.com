  description: "A large, stately wading bird with pale gray upperparts, white head and neck with a bold black stripe extending from above the eye to long trailing black plume feathers on the nape, and a dagger-like yellowish bill. In flight, shows broad rounded wings with black flight feathers and retracts the neck into an S-shape. Found along virtually all types of shallow waterways including rivers, lakes, marshes, estuaries, and coastal mudflats across Eurasia and Africa. Stands motionless or wades slowly when hunting fish and frogs; gives a harsh, grating 'fraaank' call, often in flight."
