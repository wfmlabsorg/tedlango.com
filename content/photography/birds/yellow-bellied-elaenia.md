  description: "A medium-sized, somewhat nondescript flycatcher with olive-brown upperparts, two whitish wing bars, and pale yellowish underparts with an olive-gray wash on the breast. A small, often concealed whitish or pale yellow crown patch is visible when the bird raises its bushy crest. One of the most widespread and common elaenias, found in gardens, forest edges, scrubby second growth, and urban parks. Often perches conspicuously on exposed branches; gives a distinctive harsh, burry 'bree-er' dawn call."
