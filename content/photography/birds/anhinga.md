  description: "A large, slender waterbird with a very long serpentine neck, dagger-like yellowish bill, and a long, fan-shaped tail. Males are mostly glossy black with silver-white streaks on the wing coverts and scapulars; females and immatures have a buffy-tan head, neck, and breast. Often seen swimming with only the head and neck above water, giving a snake-like appearance. Frequents freshwater lakes, rivers, and swamps, and is commonly seen perching with wings spread to dry after diving for fish."
