  description: "A large, striking plover with a distinctive wispy black crest, metallic bronzy-green upperparts, black breast band, and white belly. In flight, shows broad white wing bars and a black tail band. The legs are reddish and the bill is red with a black tip. Common in open grasslands, pastures, wetland margins, agricultural fields, and urban parks across South America. Highly vocal and aggressively territorial, swooping at intruders while giving strident, metallic 'tero-tero' alarm calls."
