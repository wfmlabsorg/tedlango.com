  description: "A small toucan with predominantly emerald-green plumage, a large bill that is black and yellow with variable red or maroon markings near the base, and a small chestnut patch on the rump. The throat can be whitish to bluish depending on subspecies. Found in humid montane forests and cloud forests of the Andes, typically between 1,200 and 3,000 meters. Usually forages in pairs or small groups in the canopy, feeding on fruits and occasionally insects; gives a series of barking or yelping calls."
