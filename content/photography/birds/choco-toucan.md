  description: "A large toucan with mostly black plumage, a bright yellow upper breast and throat bib, and a massive bicolored bill that is yellow and dark with a yellowish ridge. The rump is bright red and the bare facial skin around the eye is greenish-yellow. Endemic to the Choco bioregion, found in humid lowland and foothill forests west of the Andes in Colombia and Ecuador, typically below 1,500 meters. Usually forages in the canopy in pairs or small groups, eating fruits and occasionally preying on small animals; gives a series of loud, yelping croaks."
