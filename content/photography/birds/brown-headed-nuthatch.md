  description: "A tiny, active nuthatch with a warm brown cap extending down to the eye, a small whitish nape spot, blue-gray upperparts, and pale whitish-buff underparts. The short tail and strong feet allow it to creep acrobatically along branches and trunks, often head-down. One of few bird species documented using tools, using bark flakes to pry up other bark in search of insects. Closely associated with southeastern pine forests in the United States, particularly longleaf and loblolly pines. Highly social outside breeding season, forming chatty flocks; gives a distinctive, squeaky rubber-duck-like 'yank-yank' call."
