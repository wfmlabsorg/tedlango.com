  description: "A large, boldly patterned flycatcher with a bright yellow belly, white throat, and striking black-and-white striped head with a concealed yellow crown patch. Stocky and heavy-billed, it is one of the most conspicuous and noisy birds in its range. Found in a wide variety of semi-open habitats from forest edges to gardens, often near water. Extremely vocal with a loud, far-carrying 'kis-ka-dee' call; hunts insects by sallying from perches and also catches small fish and frogs."
