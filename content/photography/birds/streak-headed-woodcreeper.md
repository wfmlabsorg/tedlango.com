  description: "A slender, medium-sized woodcreeper with brown upperparts, fine pale buff streaking on the crown and head, a pale supercilium, and buff-streaked underparts. The slightly decurved bill is pale and relatively slender compared to other woodcreepers. Found in dry and semi-humid forest, woodland, plantations, and gardens from Mexico to northern South America. Creeps up tree trunks and along branches probing bark crevices for insects, often joining mixed-species flocks in the canopy."
