  description: "A large, gregarious icterid with mostly dark chestnut-brown plumage, a pale greenish bill, blue eyes, and a bright yellow tail that flashes conspicuously in flight. Males are notably larger than females and perform dramatic bowing displays at colonial nesting sites, hanging their long woven basket-nests from tall trees. Inhabits humid and semi-humid forest edges, clearings, and plantations across lowland tropical America. Produces an extraordinary repertoire of liquid, gurgling calls and mechanical-sounding notes."
