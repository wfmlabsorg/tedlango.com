  description: "A large, striking motmot with a green body, rufous-brown crown bordered by turquoise-blue, black mask through the eye, and the classic racket-tipped tail formed by bare shafts ending in spatula-shaped feather tips. The broad black chest spot helps separate it from other motmots in its range. Found in humid montane forests and forest edges in the Andes, typically sitting quietly on a shaded perch. Swings its pendulum-like tail from side to side when alert; gives a deep, resonant 'hoot-hoot' call often heard at dawn."
