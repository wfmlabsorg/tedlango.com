  description: "A striking, clown-faced woodpecker with a bold black, white, and red pattern: white eyes set in a black face, red crown, white forehead, and a black chin and breast band separating the white throat from the streaked white-and-black belly. In flight, shows a conspicuous white rump and wing patches. Famous for its highly social behavior and granary trees, where colonies store thousands of acorns in individually drilled holes in dead trunks and utility poles. Gives a raucous, laughing 'waka-waka-waka' call; found in oak and pine-oak woodlands."
