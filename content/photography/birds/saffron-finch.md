  description: "Adult males are bright golden-yellow overall with a deeper orange wash on the forecrown, while females and immatures are duller with streaked olive-brown upperparts and yellowish underparts. A stocky, thick-billed finch commonly found in open and semi-open areas including lawns, parks, agricultural fields, and urban environments. Often forages on the ground in small flocks, picking at seeds and grain. A cavity nester that readily uses nest boxes and crevices in buildings; gives a pleasant warbling song from elevated perches."
