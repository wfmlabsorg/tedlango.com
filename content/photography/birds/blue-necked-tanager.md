  description: "A small, jewel-like tanager with a shimmering turquoise-blue head and neck, velvety black mask through the eye, and straw-yellow to golden shoulder patches contrasting with dark blue-black wings and back. Underparts vary from purplish-blue to greenish depending on subspecies. Found in humid montane forests and edges in the Andes and adjacent lowlands, typically in the canopy and subcanopy. Forages actively in mixed-species flocks, feeding on small fruits and insects gleaned from foliage."
