  description: "A medium-sized hummingbird with glittering green upperparts and breast, a distinctive dark steely-blue to purplish rump and uppertail coverts, and a nearly straight black bill. The tail is dark with a slight steel-blue gloss. Common in gardens, forest edges, and semi-open areas in the Colombian Andes and adjacent valleys. Territorial at flowering plants and feeders; gives sharp, high-pitched chip notes and a rapid chattering call during aggressive encounters."
