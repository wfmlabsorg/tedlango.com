  description: "North America's smallest and most colorful falcon, with a rusty-red back and tail, blue-gray wings in males, and a bold facial pattern featuring two black vertical 'sideburn' stripes on a white face. Females are larger with rufous-barred wings and back. Found in open habitats including grasslands, farmland, roadsides, and urban areas across the Americas. Hunts from perches or by hovering in place, dropping down onto insects, small mammals, and lizards. Gives a rapid, high-pitched 'killy-killy-killy' call."
