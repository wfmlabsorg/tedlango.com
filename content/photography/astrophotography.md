All images captured in 2014 using remote telescopes through the [iTelescope](https://www.itelescope.net/) network. Observatories in New Mexico, California, Spain, and Australia provided access to both northern and southern hemisphere skies through instruments ranging from wide-field Takahashi refractors to deep-field Planewave CDK reflectors up to 27 inches in aperture.
